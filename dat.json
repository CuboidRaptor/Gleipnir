Yes, I recommend you mute those channels, or *the sound of discord pings will vibrate in your brain forever. No one can escape the discord pings.* Uh, where was I?",
		"No NSFW, *just. don't.* If you're wondering how strict this rule is, idgaf tbh figure it out.",
		"Don't abuse Staff powers, e.g randomly warning/kicking/banning people for no reason (unless it's april fools, duh)",
		"Don't be a jerk, remember that everyone else is also a human *(mostly)*, i.e eating other people's dino nuggies, which will get you **PERMABANNED**.",
		"No swearing, words like \"damn\" are allowed but not words like \"f\\*\\*\\*\". If you censor it with spoilers, then you're okay. (in case you don't know, surround your text with \\|\\|, for example ||fuck||). For a full list of swear words, head over to https://www.imtoolazytomakealistofbannedswearwordsjustdontswearalright.com",
		"No politics, except in <#946841917847650324>. If you mention Trump, I will **a n g e r y**, because obviously only I'm allowed to do that.",
		"No racism/sexism/homophobia/insert other form of discrimination here/hate, unless the target that you hate is a political group, in which case feel free to discuss it in <#946841917847650324>, so you can get into a fight with someone else and I can spend 12 hours a day moderating some idiots. Yay, sounds like great fun.",
		"No Trojan viruses, malware, ransomware, spyware/keyloggers, or ANYTHING of the like; You will be permabanned for breaking this rule. And if I even *see* the word \"nitroclaimer\" appear from someone advertising it I will ban you so hard that your brains will liquefy into apple juice.",
		"No rude nicks/names, zalgo and weird unicode thingies with intent to annoy/disrupt will not be permitted, because some people might even want to have working eyeballs.",
		"Use channels for their express purpose only. *(staff, don't screw with logs)* For example, <#955239604007628820> is for counting, <#943931837250699264> is for bumping the server, and <#946841917847650324> is for waging vicious flame wars with literally *everyone who disagrees with you*.",
		"No excessive mentioning, e.g `@everyone` and `@here` or mass pinging one person repeatedly a lot of times or pinging a role for no reason, for example `@Verified Member`, unless it's  the Ex-Con role, because, like american society, we don't give a ||fuck|| about people who made honest mistakes and are now doomed forever because of said mistake, as they look for someone who will accept them, ultimately realizing that their situation is impossible and that life is meaningless. /j",

		"Do not try to make people harm themselves or others in the real world. Tf is even the point of doing this? *(I mean, other than if you've taken out life insurance on them and convincing them to commit suicide is a clever ploy to eat something other than plain white bread for once, that might be a point)*",
		"Do not make loud or disruptive noises or play extremely loud/annoying music in VCs without prior consent of *everyone* in the channel. And I do mean everyone. No Earrape Mogolovonio until *all the people in the VC* have agreed.",

			"Anyways, <#953087489252405288> and <#953087601663954994> are 32 kbps instead of 64 kbps, so if you're on bad internet and you don't want to be DDoSed when you VC, you can use those ones.",

			"Q: What is CP?",

		[
			"Q: Why are your bot jokes so crude?",
